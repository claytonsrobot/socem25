Letters and numbers with internal loops (R,A,B,P,Q,O,D,6,8,9,0) require a special algorithm.

Imagine a bicycle inner tube, that, rather than being a complete circle, like an O shape, is instead a C shape, with the two ends touching.

Baloon animals.

A letter or number with one internal loop (O, P, R) will have to be C shaped.

A letter or number with two internal loops (B, 0, 8) will have to be S shaped.

You also need to list all points of interesection, even for straight and closed lines.
